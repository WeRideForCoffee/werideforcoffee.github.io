Github Pages hosting and git management for my personal website.

Currently in the middle of a transition to a more fully-featured static site and migrating away from the relatively stock `w3.css` styling it was originally based on for it's "Coming Soon" early version.

Coming features include a static blog, further social media integrations and continual iteration on the site design and theming.

Eventually I want to move to static site generation from source data, to simplify adding new blog posts and to ease changing site-wide styling.
