		<p>This is hardly an exhaustive list, but to whet your appetite please enjoy a *sneak peak* at a few of my major projects currently underway:</p>
		<img src="images/project_preview_wide.webp" alt="Side by side panel of screenshots showcasing previews of the Stranded Sky game project and RTX Remix modded Morrowind and Oblivion" width="1024" height="300" class="fadeout" style="max-width:1024px;max-height:300px;height:auto;width:100%">
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>Stranded Sky - Multiplayer Voxel Sandbox:</h2>
			<p>My take on the voxel sandbox complete with physics-driven floating islands, movement and vehicles, extensive modding support built into the foundations and enhanced graphical capabilities as the cherry on top.</p>
			<p>My current efforts are still focused on building a stable mechanical foundation for the game in what precious time I can put aside for it, but any and all updates <i>will</i> be posted here!</p>
			<img src="images/stranded_sky_wip_wide.webp" alt="Two screenshots of the Stranded Sky game project, one depicting a floating voxel island and the other, the game's physics based movement" width="1024" height="300" style="max-width:1024px;max-height:300px;height:auto;width:100%">
			<br>
			<br>
		<h2>Custom HEMA Gauntlets</h2>
			<p>Frustrated by the lack of options in Australia, and brutal overseas shipping and currency conversion costs I have been developing 5-finger articulated armoured gauntlets for use with sword fighting, with a focus on providing both excellent protection and the capability to provide <i>entirely custom sizing</i>.</p>
			<p>For the time being, I don't have any compelling sizzle-reel screenshots for this project, but of the three projects presented here this is the one I'll be focusing on next, so stay tuned!</p>
			<br>
		<h2>RTX Remix Modding - Morrowind, Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas</h2>
			<p>Driven by my passion for gaming and modding, I have been working to integrate NVIDIA's RTX Remix fully path traced renderer with many classic games from the early and mid 2000s, including every Bethesda Softworks title from (and including) Morrowind all the way to technically supporting the <i>original</i> version of Skyrim!</p>
			<p>To showcase this, I'm considering putting together a narrative driven video series centered on the Fallout New Vegas DLC <i>Dead Money</i>... and I think it will be something special, but you'll have to stick around to find out.</p>
			<img src="images/wrfc_morrowind_khuul.webp" alt="Screenshot of the costal village of Khuul from Morrowind with path traced lighting" width="1023" height="769" style="max-width:1023px;max-height:769px;height:auto;width:100%">

		<p>Projects heavily feature the <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot Game Engine</a> and I plan to make some tutorials available as I go featuring some of the more outlandish things you can achieve with it, so stay tuned on my socials or bookmark this page for more info on that as it occurs.</p>
